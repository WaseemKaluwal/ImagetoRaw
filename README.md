Convert Any Image into Raw Image Using C# WinForms
Overview
Convert Any Image into Raw Image is a simple C# WinForms application that allows users to convert standard image formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP, etc.) into raw image data. This tool is useful for developers and engineers who need raw pixel data for image processing, embedded systems, or custom rendering applications.

Features
Load Standard Image Formats: Supports JPEG, PNG, BMP, and GIF.
Convert to Raw Format: Extracts uncompressed pixel data from images.
Save Raw Image: Exports the processed data in RAW format.
RGB and Grayscale Support: Works with both color and grayscale images.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple buttons to load, convert, and save images.
How It Works
The application reads the pixel data of the selected image.
Extracts raw RGB or grayscale values from the image.
Saves the data in a binary raw file without compression or headers.
The raw image can then be used for custom image processing, machine learning, or embedded applications.
